# Testing-Dummy-Website

I created test cases that are used for automation testing using Selenium C#. Each folder will contain a link to the dummy website being tested, the test scenario in pdf form, and the automation testing code. 

Tested website:
1. https://www.saucedemo.com/
2. https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/
3. https://www.automationexercise.com/
